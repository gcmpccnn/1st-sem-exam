            <p class="anim">In this project, we learned how to collect data in several different ways.<br>
            We first had to do a "<b>Desk Research</b>" which consists of collecting data on a specific topic by reading articles online.<br>
            Then the "<b>Observation Research</b>" came in (my personal favorite), where we were asked to step outside our classroom/rooms and go in the real world to observe a real situation. <br>
            I went to a public bus stop and I collected information about everything I could see: people passing by, waiting for the bus, etc...<br>
            Then, in the "<b>Interview Research</b>" I had to interview someone on a specific topic. 10 minutes of interview might sound like nothing, but I learned that you need to have a lot of questions prepared if you want to cover that much time!</p>

            <p class="anim">This was one of our first "group" projects:<br>
            In groups of two, we had to come up with an idea, a project of a website that could help new international students in Copenhagen.<br>
            We decided to cover the accommodation issue, we think that finding an apartment or house is one of the most difficult things to do in Copenhagen, especially if you're new to everything!<br>
            Here we learned how to use and how important it is to do the <b>Think Aloud Test</b>: you ask somebody external to your project to try and navigate through your website saying out loud what his thoughts are while going through the section of the prototype.</p>

            <p class="anim">The assignment "Design Sprint" was definitely one of my favorite ones. <br>
            Probably because I had a really good group and everything went extremely smoothly.<br>
            The teamwork was great!<br>
            We used the "<b>design sprint</b>" method to create and present to possible customers (teachers) the prototype of a smartphone app which could improve the life of KEA students.<br>
            From <b>Monday</b> to <b>Friday</b> we woked all together with the group dividing tasks to every single member.<br>
            We started with a big brainstorming with ideas and finished with a pitch presentation.<br>
            I personally did the <b>Adobe XD</b> prototype and some graphics as well.</p>
