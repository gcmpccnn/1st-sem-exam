            <p class="anim">This was definitely the most fun project to make!<br>
            We did a collaboration with <b>Food Sharing Copenhagen</b>:<br>
            we had to pick a topic, either try to get more people to be <b>volunteers</b> or spread awareness about <b>food waste</b>.<br>
            We build a website around that topic and filmed a <b>video</b> that could advertise our idea.<br>
            A good group and great teamwork have never been more important.<br>
            I have always been into filming and editing video but I never really had the chance to do it so this assignment was perfect for me. <br>
            I took full responsibility for the video production and editing.<br>
            Filming the video with the Food Sharing Copenhagen volunteers themselves was the key! My whole group was really happy with the video.</p>

            <p class="anim">Before making the video we had to make a storyboard.<br>
            I've never made a storyboard for a video before.<br>
            It definitely helped me a lot, having a storyline to follow when you're "on set" filming is very nice and can save you lots of time.<br>
            On the other hand, I learned that sometimes things don't go as planned on the storyboard so you more than often will have to <b>improvise</b>. </p>

            <p class="anim">Now, the website is ready, the video is ready, everything's ready!<br>
            Time to give a pitch presentation to <b>Food Sharing Copenhagen</b> itself!<br>
            We decided to divide the presentation into two parts: first with <b>PDFs slides</b> and then show the actual <b>website</b>.<br>
            We kept the slides really simple. We didn't want to have a lot of text on them, we rather speak and tell the customers what our idea is about than having them reading our slides.<br>
            The best part of the Customer Pitch was that at the end everybody immediately gave us <b>feedback</b> on our presentation and project.<br>
            Now we know what to fix for the next time!</p>
