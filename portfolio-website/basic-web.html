            <p class="anim">The main topic covered in Theme 02 Basic Web was the <b>Responsive Website</b>.<br>
                The teachers assigned us a topic, mine was obviously Bauhaus.<br>
                We had to do researches on the topic and, when we had enough information, build a responsive website around it; with articles and images.<br>
                But what is a responsive website? A responsive website means that your website will look nice and clean no matter what the resolution of the device the user is using is.<br>
                It could be a computer, a tablet, a phone or even a TV. The website will automatically change to give the user the best experience possible.<br>
                This assignment helped me a lot! Now I know how important <b>breakpoints</b> are and I even know how to use them for my next website!</p>
