            <p class="anim">In this project, we started by getting inspiration from different animated characters online and we created a moodboard. <br>
            Then we created our character and finally the background.
            I didn√¨'t know that you could use <b>CSS</b> to animate a character you made!<br>
            I had to create different versions of my character in various positions and then switch them quickly using CSS to create a sort of animation.<br>
            It was really challenging! I couldn't get it to work the first time because you have to be really precise with the resolution of your character; but, at the end, everything turned out well.</p>

            <p class="anim">Here we go again with our character!<br>
            In this project, we had to build a website with our character and various buttons.<br>
            By pressing on the buttons the character will change his <b>attributes</b> such as opacity, positions, color, etc...<br>
            The real challenge was making sure that the user knew which button was pressed and which action was running.<br>
            We basically had to highlight the pressed button, but if the user pressed another button while another one was already pressed and the action was running the new button will have to be highlighted and the previous one which was highlighted will have to return normal.</p>

            <p class="anim">In this other group assignment, we were divided into groups of two.<br>
            The teachers showed us a website with different "games" and they challenged us to recreate some of them without looking at the code.<br>
            Having the final result in front but have to recreate it from scratch it's not as easy as I thought.<br>
            My groupmate and I recreated a fairly simple one but at the same time, I learned a lot from it!<br>
            In this project we had to deal with <b>strings</b>. We gave the user some input fields where he could type in things such as age, email, etc... and we had to check each string to give the user some information.<br>Try it yourself!</p>

            <h1 class="anim">04.04.01 Onboarding</h1>
            <p class="anim">The Onboarding assignment was one of the most difficult ones for us.<br>
            We were divided into groups of 4/5 and we had to come up with an interactive web-based <b>onboarding sequence</b> that could explain an important aspect of moving to Denmark through some games.<br>
            We, of course, started with a brainstorm, everybody in the group talked about their ideas.<br>
            Then we wanted to divide the project into tasks and assign each task to a member of the group, but unfortunately, nobody was THAT good at coding so we all had to help a little bit in coding while doing our main task.<br>
            I don't really like coding but it's good training every time I have to do it.<br>
            I was more focused on graphics such as the main character or the background images.<br>
            Our "game" was really simple compared to the others but we really liked how it turned out because everybody gave <b>110%</b> for that project! The teachers liked it too!</p>
